There are several folders containing the raw output of the same conditions
with different integrations to compare their accuracy. 

In "Comparison" I have combined gifs of those simulations to show animated comparisons, and made a labeled pdf with the three side by side.

You can use ExampleRun.py to run a simulation of your own, with input from the 
user to choose many options of your simulation.

CreateRandomParticles.py will create random particles and store them into dataset.h5
There is no user input, to modify you much change the file directly

"_updated.h5" will contain the updated positions of particles after a run through ExampleRun 

***IntegrationAnalysis.ipnb***
Contains code to time different integrators and compare...
